Project 1: Can we predict what makes a song popular? 
The musical landscape has changed drastically since the inception of the Billboard Top 100. Different genres and musical styles have fallen in and out of popularity over the years because musical preference is a subjective thing. However is it possible that a song's popularity can be linked to more intrinsic characteristics? For example, give the year or time of year can we predict the popularity of a song based on different metadata factors such as musical key, mode, tempo, time signature or song duration? 
Does the lyrical content also play a role in influencing a song's popularity?   How does the frequency of certain key words change over time? For example, which years have more popular songs about falling in love versus heartbreak? Does this change throughout the year? Is there any correlation with major events taking place in the world at that time? 
For this project we would collect data from the Billboard Top 100 database as well as the Million Song Dataset http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/. This project has been considered to some extent here: http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2015/145_report.pdf, although the authors do not consider lyrical content. We should note that one very big possible drawback to this project is the ridiculously large size of the dataset.
